# 🌞🌙 Day/Night Visualiser

A dynamic and visually appealing Day/Night Visualiser built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project changes the background gradient and displays a sun or moon icon based on the real-time hour. Perfect for understanding time-based dynamic styling and animations!

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Background Gradient**: The background transitions between a bright daytime gradient and a dark nighttime gradient based on the current hour.
- **Dynamic Icons**: Displays a sun icon during the day (6 AM to 6 PM) and a moon icon during the night (6 PM to 6 AM).
- **Live Clock**: Shows the current time in `HH:MM:SS` format, updated every second.
- **Smooth Animations**: Includes smooth transitions for background changes and a rotating effect on the icon.
- **Glassmorphism Design**: A modern and professional UI with a glass-like effect for the visualiser container.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the project.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations, including gradients and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: For real-time logic and dynamic updates.
- **Font Awesome**: For high-quality sun and moon icons.
